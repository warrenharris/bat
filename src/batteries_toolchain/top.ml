(**
   This file is meant to be invoked by a toplevel and performs initialization
   of OCaml Batteries Included and its libraries.

   Initialization consists in
   - loading Findlib
   - loading dependencies
   - initializing and starting Camlp4
   - loading syntax extensions
   - loading the contents of the on-line help system
   - printing a welcome message

   To take advantage of this file, run
   [ocaml -init top.ml] (or, equivalently, use our customized version of [ocaml])
*)

Sys.interactive := false;; (*Pretend to be in non-interactive mode to avoid toplib messages*)
#use "topfind";;
#require "num";;       (*For some reason, if [num] is not loaded before Camlp4, an exception is launched*)
#require "netstring";; (*For some reason, if [netstring] is not loaded before Camlp4, an exception is launched*)
                       (*Note: a common point between num and netstring is that they both define custom printers
			 for the toplevel. This may be the reason for this bug.*)
